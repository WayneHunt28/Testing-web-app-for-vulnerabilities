Hello, Wayne Hunt! Congratulations on an outstanding homework assignment! You’ve demonstrated techniques for hardening websites, explored web vulnerabilities, and developed strategies for mitigating them! 
On the same note, you've successfully exploited a vulnerability in the first web app, and you've captured a screenshot which confirms access to /etc/hosts! 
You've also recommended great mitigation strategies that include server-side validation, access control and least privilege control. 
You've done a great job with this deliverable! 
Wayne, you've successfully brute-forced your second web app! a screenshot which confirms the exploit and a successful login. 

You've also recommended great mitigation strategies that include account policies such as improving password strength, password lockout and multi-factor authentication (MFA). 
You've done a great job with this deliverable! Now, Wayne, your work on the final app exploit is awesome! You’ve confirmed that your attack was successful. 
You've captured a screenshot that depicts the hooked browser in the navigation pane. You’ve also recommended mitigation strategies that include server-side input validation and built-in browser controls! 
Amazing job here! 

I was impressed with your detailed presentation of how you have exploited each website. This showed great understanding and execution, this was followed up by great mitigation strategies that were recommended. 
This has been an amazing assignment to understand how to perform a web application vulnerability assessment and site hardening Wayne; keep up the good work and this smooth flow you've established!
